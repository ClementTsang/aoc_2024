# Day 23

We're almost at the end! Today's solution is just another networkx show, been a good learning opportunity this year for it. Most of this is just a trip down memory lane to university and graph theory where we learned about _cliques_, which are effectively a bunch of vertices (nodes) where each vertex is a neighbour of the other vertices.
