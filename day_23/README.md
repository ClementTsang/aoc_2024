# Day 23

We're almost at the end! Today's solution is just another networkx show, been a good learning opportunity this year for it. Part 1 I just brute forced by detecting cycles of length 3 since that's effectively what you get if you have 3 nodes that all connect to each other, and part 2 is a trip down memory lane to university when I took graph theory and learned about maximal cliques.
